utc-schedule
============

This repository, initially developed for a IA04 UTC project, contains some java stuff to retrieve UTC's schedules as JSON format and get some nice data about the rooms / UVs .

You will retrieve:

* The raw "'EDT" files
* The room schedules / the UVs that take place in these rooms
* Some data about the UVs (number of students enrolled, their semesters, ...)
* The list of semesters people are in 
* The user schedules

You'll need a valid UTC CAS account to retrieve this data obviously.

To use it, you can use the main mehod in com.slepetit.utc.schedule.Schedule
